# Transit-Photometry-Based-N-Body-Simulation
I made an N-body simulation with planets and stars to model the orbital mechanics for a hypothetical planetary system. This simulation can demonstrate the orbits that result from the planets and star interacting with each other and explore the stability and dynamics related to exoplanetary systems. With the N-body simulation complete, I simulated the photometric properties of this system including when the planets transit in front of the star. That transit results in a "transit curve" which he computes, plots, and analyzes. The analysis let me determine the planet's radius and orbital distance. Then through approximations on the planet radius and distance, I can estimate the planetary mass and other properties.
